# seva_finance

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

1. Run `scripts/setup_flutter.sh` to install the Flutter SDK locally. This script downloads Flutter and adds it to your `PATH`.
2. After the SDK is installed, you can run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` to validate the project.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the [online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
